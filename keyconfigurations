max_prediction_length and max_encoder_length: Specify the prediction length and the length of historical data used for predictions, respectively. In this project, we use data from the past 30 days (max_encoder_length = 30) to forecast the next 3 days (max_prediction_length = 3).

training = TimeSeriesDataSet(...): Configures the dataset for training with specific features and parameters. Key parameters include:

time_varying_known_categoricals: Categorical variables known throughout the dataset, such as 'month', 'day of the week', etc.
time_varying_known_reals: Continuous variables known in the past and future, like 'time_idx'.
time_varying_unknown_reals: Continuous variables known only in the past, including the target feature set via args.target_feature.
group_ids: Identifiers for each time series in the dataset. For instance, 'destination' could be a grouping identifier in a tourism dataset.
target: The target variable to predict, defined by args.target_feature.
target_normalizer: Applies a normalization method (like 'softplus') to the target variable, beneficial for stabilizing training.
